  <p class="about-paragraph">
    My photography is primarily concerned with how the mind uses memory to interpret reality despite its diffused, amorphous nature. The subject of my work pins memory as a collection of dreamlike hallucinations that we have forced into a unified shape that is at once comforting and unimaginably remote. 
  </p>
  <p class="about-paragraph">
    The different pieces that make up my work don’t slot together conventionally, instead they flash in and out of each other with dreamlike whimsy. They are perpetually swinging between the oneiric nature of representational remembrance and the apparent-lucidity of episodic memory, blurring the real and the fantastical, the memories and the vision, questioning if they can ever be discerned.
